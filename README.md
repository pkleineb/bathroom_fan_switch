# WTF is this?
In my current bathroom I have a fan that is supposed to suck out all the humid air after showering. It works there is just one small problem... it turns off after ~5 minutes. Since that isn't enough time at all, my bathroom always smells pretty awful because of the very humid air. Whats the solution? Obviously creating a smart switch with a humidity sensor, that activates itself when the humidity is too high.
